   <p>Here are a lot of all of the graphs and data sets used in our project</p>
   <p>The first image is the data for the CO2 emissions for different countries around the world. The goal of this was to 
     use the CO2 data to effectively compare and analyze the human activity associated with the different countries. In the spreadsheet
     below, we have the list of countries, as well as the CO2 emissions for each of them. 
     <br><br>
     We also have color codes associated with the
     values, so countries can keep track of a CO2 emissions, and adjust their human activity accordingly. The colors are listed 
     in the cells as either yellow, orange, red, and green, with green meaning that the country is safe to operate normally, while
     red would indicate that the country would be at risk of contracting more COVID-19 cases. 
     <br><br>
     Research has indicated that increased
     levels of CO2 and NO2 emissions would result in more coronavirus cases and deaths worldwide, which is why the data used from NASA
     would be reliable in helping countries monitor their cases when reopening.

   </p>
   <br>

   <br><br>
   <p>Next, we used this data in order to plot of histogram of all the countries specific emissions. This is a better 
     representation of how we used the data from NASA in order to visualize the amount of CO2 emissions each country had,
     and how they correlated to the number of COVID-19 cases. 
     <br><br>
     Notably, China's CO2 emissions are the most in the world, as
     seen in the large spike in the data. Therefore, it is not surprise that China had one of the worst outbreaks of the 
     COVID-19 virus when it was introduced to the world. 
   </p>

   <br>
   <p>Though an analysis of flight patterns from China, we were able to discern a noticable pattern between flights and COVID-19 cases 
     domestically and internationally and attribute the flights to the cases.
     <br><br>
     The correlation coefficient of the regression line is 0.97, which indicates
     a strong positive correlation between the number of passengers on a flight from
     China and the number of COVID-19 cases. 
     <br><br>
     The eastern region particularly is interesting in that 
     a lot of cases seem to have originated from there. This is 
     an important idea to note in order to examine with more detail the 
     certain regions of China and how they contributed to the spread of the virus,
     especially to other countries.
   </p>
   <br>

   <br>
   <p>Here is another graphical represenation of how the 
     demographics of Chinese citizens plays into the spread
     of the virus.
     <br><br>
     The histogram indicates that the Eastern economic region
     of China has the most number of COVID-19 cases in China,
     and therefore the flights containing people from that region
     would expect to spread COVID-19 more to 
     surrounding areas. By interpreting this data, we can look at 
     specific areas and identify key hotspots and potential hotspots
     judging by the demographics of a flight. These examples were 
     from China, but this method could be extended to those of Europe, South 
     America, Africa, Australia, etc. 
   </p>
   <br>
   <img src="images/covid2.jpg">
   <p>This map below shows the extent to which other countries were impacted by flights from China. Mainland China has been impacted the most 
     by flights from/to China, while Australia, the United States, and Europe have also been affected by flights. This map illustrates how
     flights from China are very significant factors when considering the spread of COVID-19. 
     <br><br>
     From the graph, we see that East China has over 70%
     of international flight routes from China, while Europe, 
     North America, and the Southwest Pacific regions have
     10% of international flight routes from China. 
     <br><br>
     Through the data, we can attribute the spread 
     of COVID-19 with the flights from China, particularly
     from the East China, where the number of cases
     seem to be the most in the country.
